%   #const n: the time steps range from 0 to n
%   edge(N1,N2): there is an (undirected) edge between nodes N1 and N2
%   robot(R,C,N): robot R is of class C and starts at node N
%   job(J,C,D): job J is of class C and its deadline is D 
%   operation(J,O,N): J's operation O takes place at node N (O >= 1)

% Output:
%   at(R,N,T): robot R is at node N at time step T
%   assign(R,J,I): assign to R the job J at index I (in the sequence of jobs assigned to R) (I >= 1)
